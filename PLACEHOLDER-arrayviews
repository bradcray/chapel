* updom used to store a defaultRectangular
  - this is why lulesh-simple broke
* but really, it should store the domain being used to do the reindexing -- e.g., if
  I reindex with a block-distributed domain, that should be the upward-looking view
  for the user I think.
* trouble is in setIndices, which currently stores a default rectangular -- see the
  comment on it about how this should really be implemented.
  - Q: what should the domain of a reindexed array behave like if the up and down domains
    have different distributions?
  - Q: should we stop doing reindexing on array argument passing?
