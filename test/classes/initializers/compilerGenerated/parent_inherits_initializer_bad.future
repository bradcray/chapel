bug: improper initializer matching

This test expects to fail because the parent can't call the grandparent
initializer because it takes in arguments and the init call expects no
arguments.  However, because the grandparent class defines an initializer with
the same number of arguments as the intended child default initializer and it is
not compiler generated, we think that one is a better match and skip the error
case entirely.

Basically, we need to not treat initializers as inheritable.
