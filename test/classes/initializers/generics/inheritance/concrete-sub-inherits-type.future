feature request: inheritance from generic classes with initializers

Initializers on subclasses when the parent class is generic currently run into
issues.  When the subclass is concrete, we get an assertion error during
initializerResolution.  When the subclass is generic, we get an issue with an
argument being generic when we don't expect it to be.  These are both
resolvable issues, but I haven't taken the time to fix them yet.
