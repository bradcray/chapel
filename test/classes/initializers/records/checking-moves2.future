bug: issue with copy initializers and auto copy

While `var x = returnRec();` works for concrete records that define
initializers, `var x: Rec = returnRec();` currently encounters an error in
function resolution, even if a valid copy initializer is defined.  This seems
to be because we are not validating our autoCopy function for concrete records
with initializers (because they might not work and we only want that to be
an issue if an autoCopy is needed), but we are not validating the autoCopy
later either.

Discussion on this future occurred in the PR that added it, #6564
