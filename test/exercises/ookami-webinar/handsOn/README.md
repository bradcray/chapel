Hands-on Exercises

* Advent of Code 2021 Day 1: given an array of numbers, compute some
  simple statistics on it
  o This is a trivial computation that you’d have no trouble doing in
    a language you’re familiar with
  o Goal is to use it to get familiar with Chapel
  o Opportunities for array operations, data parallelism, reductions
  o see adventOfCode2021/day1.chpl

* Advent of Code 2021 Day 4: simulate a bingo game with an octopus
  o This is slightly more involved and interesting, but still straightforward
  o More opportunities for array operations, data parallelism, 2D arrays
  o see adventOfCode2021/day4.chpl

* Ray Tracer: given a ray tracing framework, fill in some missing
  details to make it work
  o Exercises 2D arrays, data parallelism
  o see c-ray/README

* Bounded Buffer: use Chapel’s sync and atomic variables 
  o Exercises task parallelism and synchronization—relies on
    sync/atomic variables, not really covered today
  o see boundedBuffer/README
