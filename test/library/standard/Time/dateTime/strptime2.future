unimplemented feature: strptime() doesn't support '%f' flag

#16922

This version of the test uses a variant signature which was
implemented in #17453 but then later backed out, in which strptime()
is defined as a method on 'datetime' values rather than as a type
method on 'datetime' itself.  This seems potentially appealing, though
I was unable to find any design discussion about the tradeoffs between
the two approaches.
