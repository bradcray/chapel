error message: bad sync/single types sometimes point to internal code

For some reason, this test points to the internal
ChapelSyncSingle.chpl module due to the bad sync/single type whereas
the test test/parallel/sync/bradc/testBadSyncSingle.chpl points to
user code (differences include: module-scope variable vs. local
variable; simple type expression vs. more complex type expression,
...).  This matches some errors that Kyle saw recently where compiler
errors in internal/standard string code were pointing to the Chapel
modules rather than the user code.  I'm not sure what the cause is but
believe that a good error message with a bad location is better than
continuing to support syncs/singles of record type for now.
