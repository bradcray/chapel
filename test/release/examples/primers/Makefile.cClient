# This makefile is for building the cClient portion of the interopWithC primer.
# The interopWithC target of the main makefile generates a library and helper
# makefile (lib/Makefile.interopWithC), which defines variables that aid in
# linking to the library. This Makefile you're viewing now (Makefile.cClient)
# creates a C Client that links and uses the library.
