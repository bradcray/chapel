bug: enums declared in class scope don't work with initializers yet

The spec says that it is legal to declare an enum within the top level
scope of a class (as well as classes, records, and unions).  However,
in the initializer-based world we don't support these yet.

This future covers omitted initialization of a field declared with that enum
type as its type (and explicitly naming a constant to set it in Phase 2)
