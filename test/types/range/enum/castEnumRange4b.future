bug: the compiler omits an expected warning

The compiler needs to generate an unstable warning
upon each cast from a range of ints to a range of enums.
Currently this warning is generated only the first time
the range cast is instantiated for a given pair of (source, target)
range types.

This is due to the warning getting factored out into a helper function,
checkEnumIdx(), in #23099. As a workaround, we could undo the factoring
at the cost of replicating the warning code 4x.
