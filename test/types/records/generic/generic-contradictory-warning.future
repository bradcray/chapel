error message: for generic R, R() incorrectly warns about presence of ()

There's also a minor awkward wording in the current warning:

  ...for example with 'R(?)'...

where the 'with' seems odd to me.  I've proposed just dropping the
'with' in the .good file, but am open to other options as well.
