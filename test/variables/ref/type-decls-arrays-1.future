bug: missing checks that the runtime types match

When declaring the type of a reference to a domain or array,
the runtime types of the declared type and the referenced domain or array
must match:

ref r2: [d2] int = a1;      // require same domain identity d2 and a1.domain 
ref br2: dom2.type = dom1;  // require same dist. identity of dom1 and dom2
