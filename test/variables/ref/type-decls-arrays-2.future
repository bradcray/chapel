bug: missing checks that the runtime types match

When declaring the type of a reference to a domain or array,
the runtime types of the declared type and the referenced domain or array
must match.

This is a lighter / more obvious variant of type-decls-arrays-1.future
Here not only the identities, but also the sizes of the two domains differ.
